# Web lessons

# General teacher instruction:
- Github - one repo for all course content
- Markdown training
- Always review homework before the lesson. 

The teacher should go through the lesson plan and the additional materials for the lesson and then create their own plan for how they want to deliever the content. They should review it and any questions they have about the content in their weekly review sessions with thier mentors.

Teachers should also not be afraid to say they don't no something: Can look it up online and if unable to resolve it through that then raise in the weekly review session with the mentor
