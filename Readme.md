# General teacher instruction:
- Github - one repo for all course content
- Markdown training
- Always review homework before the lesson. 

The teacher should go through the lesson plan and the additional materials for the lesson and then create their own plan for how they want to deliever the content. They should review it and any questions they have about the content in their weekly review sessions with thier mentors.

Teachers should also not be afraid to say they don't no something: Can look it up online and if unable to resolve it through that then raise in the weekly review session with the mentor

### 3x repetition:
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5pyx5t/a_beginners_trick_i_learned_way_too_late_in_the/

1st iteration is to make sure you understand what the hell's going on and can repeat it, do you understand the functions, the loops, the getters, setters and constructs? You won't understand because you'll need to keep referring to your last attempt, hence doing it two more times.

2nd iteration is to do the same project again but this time without referring to old code at all. It's not about memorizing. It's about understanding what you want to do next and what tool you need to slap in your code to get there and knowing how to do it...well, a little memorizing comes in handy but at a certain point you're no longer memorizing and you're more just 'knowing it'. Can you clean up your code a bit? Can you DRY it out some?

3rd iteration is to build on it. Can you add another property to the Class? If it's HTML can you add 6 columns with images instead of just 2? Just add shit to the project with what you already know. Add stuff that you learned 2-3 lessons ago but haven't touched since then.
