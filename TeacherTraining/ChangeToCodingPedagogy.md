# Pedagogy aka our approach to teaching



## Core beliefs
- We believe **the ablity to code** is one of the **best tools** for an individual **to effect social change** for themselves. Therefore we teach coding.
- We believe **everyone can learn to code**
- We believe the most important skill for any coder is **the ability to self learn**. Therefore we focus on project based tasks, self-learning, and collaborative based tasks


## Lessons
1. Teach them how to self learn:
- Students present back to class on a topic. 
- Problem, students research and attempt to solve, teacher explains concepts. Students retry
- Students given homework or class assignments to research a topic. Then review what learned as a class
2. Projects
- mini project (1 day every 2 weeks)
