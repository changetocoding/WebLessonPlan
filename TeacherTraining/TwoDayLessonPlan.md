# Lesson Plans


## Techniques
### PETE Exercise
(individual/15 minutes)

One pattern that works well for programming lessons is PETE: introduce the *P*roblem, work through an *E*xample, explain the *T*heory, and then *E*laborate on a second example so that learners can see what is specific to each case and what applies to all cases. 

Pick something you have recently taught or been taught and outline a short lesson for it that follows these five steps.

Then discuss with the team on what you've created.
### PRIMM Exercise

(individual/15 minutes)

Another lesson pattern is *PRIMM* - *P*redict a programâ€™s behaviour or output, *R*un it to see what it actually does, *I*nvestigate why it does that by stepping 
through it in a debugger or drawing the flow of control, *M*odify it (or its inputs), and then *M*ake something similar from scratch. 

Pick something you have recently taught or been taught and outline a short lesson for it that follows these five steps.
