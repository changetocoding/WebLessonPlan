# Pedagogy aka our approach to teaching



## Core beliefs
- We believe **the ablity to code** is one of the best tools for an individual to effect social change for themselves
- We believe Everyone can learn to code
- We believe the most important skill for any coder is the ability to self learn. Therefore 

1. Teach them how to self learn
Present back to class on a topic. Or tell them learn x as homework or class assignment. Then review what learned
2. Projects
- mini project (1 day every 2 weeks)
- Hackathon

3. Maybe 4 weeks hmtl and js:
1st week revision of what learnt week long course. Practise and reteach in different way plus get through js online course
