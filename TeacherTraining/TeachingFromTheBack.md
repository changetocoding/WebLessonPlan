***Summary***
Learners:

1. Connections: learners make connections with what already know, what want to learn, others

2. Concepts: direct info/lecture. take info in multisenory: reflecting imagining, teaching to others, hearing seeing discussing

3. Concrete practice: actively practice/review/teach what learned
4. Conclusions: summarise, evaluate, celebrate, create action plans
In my training who is doing most of the talking

***Brain friendly training***

- Positive (&safe) Emotionally environment
- Timing (10 mins) & movement (standup)
- Music/silence/ryhme/discussions/colours/photos/learners movement/ clapping/hands/thumps up
- Variety & choices: choice of review activity. Learners teach using inst. Activities (short lect. Discus. Demo. Games. Quiz, coloured markers, etc)
- Audience take on information through participation. Do the activity.
- Ask them to do activities like discuss the content, present about it, open ended qs,
- Frame activity e.g. Time to prepare, what activity is
- Low risk activities (talk to neighbour, dot vote) to high risk.
- DON'T be boring: anti learning

***4 Cs ***

- Begin with end: what observable behaviours do you want learned
- Teach only need to knows
- Play with plan and work out flow
- Hand over as much teaching as can

***Connections***

Learners to other learners, the topic, their own goals, Learning outcomes (learners talk about L. Out.)

Remember start, middle and end best
Intros, ground rules

*Web hunt*, *Dot voting (inst. On slide/wall), where do you stand, **post it, think it then stick it, turn and talk, wall charts, table talk*

***Concepts***

- Teach only need to know. If I had 1/2 time what would I cut out
- Graphic organisers
- 10 min rule
- Interactive lecture strategies
- One min reviews

*Concept maps*,Â  *rapid response*: *come up with 5 most important facts. (2 mins)*, *beat the clock, bend breathe stretch*, *1 person/table experts (summarise and present to room), Concept centers*

***Concrete practice***

- Individual accountability
- Collaborative
- Everyone participates
- Mistakes are allowed

*Teach backs (pairs, tables, improv), in room mentoring, each teach, skill based game shows (like who wants to be a mill)*

*Learner games: card games (myth or fact), coop jeopardy*

***Conclusions***

- Learners summarise
- Learners evaluate: e.g discuss how felt before compared to now
- Learners celebrate. E.g imaginary cert. Or each learner compliments partner

*Learner logs, table talk, round Robin (pass q around and write response), where do you stand, may we quote you, *

*Celebrate: make and take, cert, *

*Circle celebration: ball toss, what enjoyed, what appreciated about group, how plan to use, walk and talk, musical chairs(I like my neighbour),*
