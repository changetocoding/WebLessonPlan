# Github
Surprisingly hard to teach.

Think should split so step by step walk through steps of how to create a repositiory on github  
Clone that repository locally  
Add a file to it  
commit set up stream then push to it  

Then update file in vs code  
stage the file commit  
Push it  

Then update file again/add a new file  
Repeat same in git hub  

Then repeat in command line  


# HW
Get them to do it locally
