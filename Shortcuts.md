# Lets talk about shortcuts.

- diff between advanced and beginner programmers
- Time saving and very important
- But be careful of 'emacs pinky' Would recommend getting an ergonomic keyboard after programing for >3 years


## Intro level:
### VS Code shortcuts should know:

Windows Default key | Command
------------ | -------------
Ctrl + Shift + P | Open command palette
Ctrl + Shift + F | Find in workspace
Ctrl + / | Comment/uncomment line
Alt + Shift + F | Format document
Ctrl + W | Close Tab (works on browsers too)
Middle Mouse | Edit several lines


I normally remap these to more easier to reach positions

### Other essential commands
Save File, Copy, Paste, Cut - I normally use a key mapping software (see below) to map to F1-F4. Or a mouse with extra buttons and cut, copy and paste programmed to it.

You do alot of window switching so learn how to do that efficently. E.g. On Windows Win+M will minimise all windows and Alt+Tab cycles through windows.

## Keymapping software
AutoHotKey - Windows  
Karabiner-Elements - Mac

## Ergonomics
tdlr:
- Learn proper seating position
- Get keyboard can remap keys or use software to remap keys (see above)
- Get trackpad or mouse with additional buttons so can remap frequent 
- Beware of emacs pinky - avoid using little finger to press ctrl, use thumb instead
- Learn to touch type properly - https://www.typingclub.com/

Tldr: You do a lot of short cuts using shift, ctrl etc.

1. Get good setup: 
- Proper seating positon
- 

2. Get a good keyboard
- Programable mechanical
or (Can use something like autohotkey on window)

3. Map backspace, ctrl to more easily accessable keys
(Can use something like autohotkey on window)

4. Learn to touch type
Worth the time investment even though you don't type letters that much

Useful keyboard shortcuts
Personal but what I found 

- Emmet abbrevations
- map rename to a single key. Like F9
- Map cut, copy and paste to a single key (like F1-F3)
- Learn shortcuts in IDE. E.g. Ctrl Shift P in VS Code
