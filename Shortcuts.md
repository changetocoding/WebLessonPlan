Tldr: You do a lot of short cuts using shift, ctrl etc.

1. Get good setup: 
- Proper seating positon
- 

2. Get a good keyboard
- Programable mechanical
or (Can use something like autohotkey on window)

3. Map backspace, ctrl to more easily accessable keys
(Can use something like autohotkey on window)

4. Learn to touch type
Worth the time investment even though you don't type letters that much

Useful keyboard shortcuts
Personal but what I found 

- Emmet abbrevations
- map rename to a single key. Like F9
- Map cut, copy and paste to a single key (like F1-F3)
- Learn shortcuts in IDE. E.g. Ctrl Shift P in VS Code
