## Github
Surprisingly hard to teach.
Think should split so step by step walk through steps of how to create a repositiory on github  
Clone that repository locally  
Add a file to it  
Commit set up stream then push to it  

Then update file in vs code  
Stage the file commit  
Push it

Then update file again/add a new file  
Repeat same in git hub  

Then repeat in command line.

## Vercel
Was dead easy for students to work out by themselves and get it done  
Think just point them at vercel website and get them to add github project they just created online

Important points:
- The root of the project must be named index.html other wise shows folder structure.
